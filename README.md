## Note
- I have used GPT 3.5 turbo model for my testing so due to its limitaion I have prompted it to ask only 3 questions after that it repeats itself,due to lack of tokens
- To make it work more powerfully we can use GPT 4 to improve its operational areas.
- Also I have not used any database as I haven't feel it to be important , but in future feature I am planning to have a Object relational database integrated in it.
